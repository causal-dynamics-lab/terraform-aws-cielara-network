Provisions the AWS networking Cielara Enterprise needs, in **your** account
with **your** credentials. After apply you hand a small JSON blob of resource
IDs back to Cielara; the Cielara Enterprise deployment then runs *into* this
VPC instead of creating its own.

## What it creates

| Resource | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| VPC | `vpc_cidr`, default `10.2.0.0/20`; DNS hostnames + support enabled (EKS requirement) |
| 2 private subnets (`+2` bits, `/22` each for a `/20`) | **all** EKS nodes + pods, RDS, EFS; tagged `kubernetes.io/role/internal-elb=1`; one per AZ |
| 2 public subnets (`+6` bits, `/26` each for a `/20`) | NAT gateways + internet-facing load balancers only — no nodes; tagged `kubernetes.io/role/elb=1`; one per AZ |
| Internet gateway | egress for the public subnets |
| NAT gateway(s) + EIP(s) | egress for the private subnets; one shared (default) or one per AZ (`ha_nat = true`) |
| Route tables + associations | public → IGW, private → NAT |

It does **not** create the EKS cluster, RDS instance, EFS filesystem, load
balancers, security groups, or VPC peering to remote clusters — Cielara creates
those after handback as part of your Cielara Enterprise deployment. For reaching
**remote private EKS clusters** over peering, apply the bundled
[`remote-cluster-connectivity`](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/causal-dynamics-lab/cielara-network/aws/latest/submodules/remote-cluster-connectivity)
submodule after this one.

## Prerequisites

- An AWS account and a region choice (default `us-east-1`).
- Credentials able to create VPC resources (`ec2:*` on VPC/subnet/NAT/EIP/route
  resources) via the standard chain: environment variables, `AWS_PROFILE`, or SSO.
- Terraform `>= 1.5`, the `aws` provider (`~> 5.60`, fetched by `init`).

## Run

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

module "cielara_network" {
  source  = "causal-dynamics-lab/cielara-network/aws"
  version = "X.Y.Z" # pin an exact released version

  region = "us-east-1" # must match the provider block
}

output "handback" {
  value = module.cielara_network.handback
}
```

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## Hand back to Cielara

```bash
terraform output -raw handback
```

Copy the JSON it prints and send it to Cielara. Shape:

```json
{
  "region": "us-east-1",
  "vpc_id": "vpc-0123456789abcdef0",
  "private_subnet_ids": ["subnet-0aaa...", "subnet-0bbb..."],
  "public_subnet_ids": ["subnet-0ccc...", "subnet-0ddd..."]
}
```

Additional outputs for the `remote-cluster-connectivity` submodule:
`vpc_cidr`, `private_route_table_ids` — wire them straight from the module
call (see the submodule's README).

## Bringing a VPC you already have

You can skip this module entirely and hand back IDs for an existing VPC, as
long as it satisfies the same contract:

- **Two private subnets in two distinct AZs**, each tagged
  `kubernetes.io/role/internal-elb = 1`, with a working default route to a NAT
  gateway (or equivalent egress) — nodes pull container images and reach AWS
  APIs from these subnets.
- **Two public subnets in two distinct AZs**, each tagged
  `kubernetes.io/role/elb = 1`, with a route to an internet gateway and
  auto-assigned public IPs.
- **VPC DNS hostnames and DNS support enabled.**
- Enough free IP space in the private subnets for the node pools plus pods
  (the AWS VPC CNI assigns pod IPs from the node subnets) — a `/22` per subnet
  is the recommended floor. All nodes run in the private subnets; the public
  pair only hosts NAT gateways and load balancers.

The `kubernetes.io/role/*` tags are how the in-cluster AWS Load Balancer
Controller discovers where to place load balancers. The cluster-scoped tag
(`kubernetes.io/cluster/<name> = shared`) is added to your subnets by the
Cielara deployment itself — the cluster name is generated at deploy time — and
removed again on teardown. Nothing else on your VPC is modified.

## IAM

You don't grant anything from this module — it needs no IAM permissions beyond
EC2 (plus `eks:DescribeCluster` for the destroy-time cleanup, see
[Destroying the network](#destroying-the-network)). The Cielara deployer role is granted everything it needs (including
describing and tagging these subnets) **once** by `prepare-eks.sh`, which an
IAM administrator runs as a single setup step.

## Destroying the network

Destroy the network only after the Cielara Enterprise deployment in it has
been torn down. Then:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

A deleted EKS cluster can leave two things in your VPC that are in no
terraform state: detached VPC CNI network interfaces (`aws-K8S-<instance-id>`,
tagged `cluster.k8s.amazonaws.com/name`), which block deleting the subnets, and
the EKS cluster security group (`eks-cluster-sg-<cluster>-<n>`, tagged
`kubernetes.io/cluster/<cluster> = owned`), which blocks deleting the VPC.
`terraform destroy` removes them first, with the `aws` CLI and the same
credentials terraform uses. It only touches resources that are:

- inside this module's VPC and subnets,
- tagged for a Cielara cluster (name starting `cdl-`), and
- for a cluster EKS reports as no longer existing.

Anything else, including resources of a Cielara cluster that is still running
or whose state can't be read, is left alone.

This step needs bash and the `aws` CLI (on Windows, Git Bash from its default
install location, or set `bash_path`), plus `ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces`,
`ec2:DeleteNetworkInterface`, `ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups`,
`ec2:DeleteSecurityGroup` and `eks:DescribeCluster`. Without them it prints
the manual steps and the destroy carries on as before.

If you created the network with an older version of this module, bump
`version`, run `terraform init -upgrade && terraform apply` (it adds one
resource and changes nothing in AWS), then destroy.

### Destroy fails with `DependencyViolation`

If a subnet or the VPC still can't be deleted, find what is left. These
commands list Cielara leftovers only; check that the cluster named in each tag
no longer exists (`aws eks describe-cluster --name <cluster>` returns
`ResourceNotFoundException`) before deleting:

```bash
aws ec2 describe-network-interfaces --region <region> \
  --filters Name=vpc-id,Values=<vpc-id> Name=status,Values=available \
            Name=tag-key,Values=cluster.k8s.amazonaws.com/name
aws ec2 delete-network-interface --region <region> --network-interface-id <eni-id>

aws ec2 describe-security-groups --region <region> \
  --filters Name=vpc-id,Values=<vpc-id> Name=group-name,Values='eks-cluster-sg-cdl-*'
aws ec2 delete-security-group --region <region> --group-id <sg-id>
```

Delete the network interfaces first, then the security group, then re-run
`terraform destroy`.

## CIDR note

`vpc_cidr` must be `/20` or larger (the module validates this — smaller blocks
carve public subnets below `/27`, the AWS ALB minimum, and starve the node
subnets of pod IP space). The subnet ranges are derived automatically: private
`/22` + `/22`, public `/26` + `/26` for the default `/20`, with the tail left
free for growth. EKS auto-selects a Kubernetes service CIDR disjoint from your
VPC, so no service CIDR coordination is needed. If you also run the Azure
module (default `10.2.0.0/20`) and ever plan to peer the two networks, give
one of them a different range — the defaults collide by design only because
each cloud is normally an island.

## Teardown

Order matters — AWS refuses to delete a VPC anything is still attached to, so
each step needs the one before it gone:

1. **The Cielara Enterprise deployment** — destroy it through Cielara. The
   cluster, its load balancers, and the database all sit in these subnets.
2. **The `remote-cluster-connectivity` submodule**, if you applied it — its
   peering connections and routes hang off this VPC.
3. **This module:**

```bash
terraform destroy   # in the root module that calls this one
```

It removes the VPC, its four subnets, the internet gateway, the NAT
gateway(s) and their Elastic IPs, and the route tables. NAT gateways take a
few minutes to delete; that is the slow part.

A destroy that stops with `DependencyViolation` means something outside this
module is still in the VPC — usually load balancers, network interfaces, or
security groups the cluster created and a deployment teardown that did not
finish left behind:

```bash
VPC=<vpc-id>   # the vpc_id in your handback
aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers \
  --query "LoadBalancers[?VpcId=='$VPC'].LoadBalancerArn" --output text
aws ec2 describe-network-interfaces --filters Name=vpc-id,Values=$VPC \
  --query 'NetworkInterfaces[].[NetworkInterfaceId,Status,Description]' --output table
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --filters Name=vpc-id,Values=$VPC \
  --query "SecurityGroups[?GroupName!='default'].[GroupId,GroupName]" --output table
```

Delete them — load balancers first, since their network interfaces go with
them — and run the destroy again; it resumes where it stopped.
